# Telecom_Team_58
This project is a telecom management system designed to manage various aspects of a telecom business, including customer accounts, service plans, payments, and benefits. It consists of two main components:

- Telecom Database: A SQL Server database to store and manage telecom-related data.
- Web Application: An ASP.NET-based web application to interact with the database and provide functionalities for administrators and customers.

## Project Overview

### Milestone 1: Database Development
The database (`Telecom_database.sql`) was designed to handle core telecom operations. It includes:
- **Tables**: Customers, accounts, payments, benefits, service plans, technical support tickets, and more.
- **Views**: For retrieving structured data like active accounts, resolved tickets, and wallet details.
- **Stored Procedures & Functions**: For operations such as plan subscriptions, cashback calculations, and account management.

### Milestone 2: Web Application Development
The web application (`Web Application`) connects to the database and provides:
- **Admin Features**:
  - Manage customer accounts and service plans.
  - View technical support tickets, payments, and wallets.
  - Perform advanced operations like updating customer points or removing benefits.
- **Customer Features**:
  - View service plans and manage subscriptions.
